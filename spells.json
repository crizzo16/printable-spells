This distortion can change your voice's pitch, cause an echo, make it sound metallic, add a layer of statis noise, or any other simple audio effect. It can't be used to completely duplicate another person's voice. You can change the mic's volume and change the nature of the distortion on your turn )no action required). YOur voice also projects through radio waves allowing you to be heard on comm sets and communication systems within 10 miles.", "You can use your action to shout into the mic.
